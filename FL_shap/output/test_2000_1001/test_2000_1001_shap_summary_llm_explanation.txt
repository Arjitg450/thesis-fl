### Prediction Assessment:
The prediction correctly identifies the traffic as benign, which aligns with the true class of benign.

### Key Contributing Factors:
1. **fe_dst2src_syn_rate (importance 0.885800)**: This feature indicates a low rate of SYN packets from destination to source, suggesting normal connection initiation behavior.
2. **fe_dst2src_fin_rate (importance 0.787017)**: The low FIN packet rate from the destination back to the source suggests that connections are not being abruptly terminated, which is typical in benign traffic.
3. **bidirectional_stddev_ps (importance 0.297167)**: This feature measures the standard deviation of packet sizes in both directions and indicates a consistent size distribution, which is characteristic of normal traffic patterns.

### Technical Interpretation:
Given that the predicted class is benign and falls under the non-PFCP attack category, we interpret the features using TCP semantics. The low SYN rate from destination to source (fe_dst2src_syn_rate) suggests that there are no unusual connection initiation attempts, which would be expected in a brute force or DDoS attack. Similarly, the low FIN packet rate (fe_dst2src_fin_rate) indicates that connections are not being prematurely terminated, further supporting benign behavior.

The bidirectional standard deviation of packet sizes (bidirectional_stddev_ps) is consistent and does not show irregularities, which would be indicative of malformed or artificial traffic often seen in attacks. This consistency supports the classification as benign traffic.

### Confidence Analysis:
A 94.1% confidence level indicates a high degree of certainty that the traffic is indeed benign. However, it should be interpreted realistically: while the model has strong evidence supporting its prediction, there remains a small margin for error (5.9%). This means that although the traffic appears to be normal based on the observed features and their behavior, continuous monitoring and further analysis are recommended to ensure no subtle malicious activities are overlooked.
