1. Overall Assessment: The network traffic is classified as anomalous due to its unusual patterns, particularly in the duration and rate of packets between source and destination IPs, which deviate significantly from normal behavior profiles for Class 4 activities typically associated with sophisticated threats or attacks.
2. Key Contributing Factors: The top features driving this classification are src2dst_duration_ms (0.411378), fe_src2dst_min_over_mean_ps (0.411378), and dst2src_stddev_piat_ms (0.370687). These features show irregularities in packet flow duration, minimum-to-mean ratio of packets per second indicating potential rate limiting or throttling techniques used by attackers to evade detection systems, and significant standard deviation in Piat time measurements suggesting inconsistent transmission times which are often a sign of malicious activities.
3. Technical Interpretation: The high duration between source and destination IPs suggests sustained communication attempts that could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control interactions typical for advanced persistent threats (APT). A low ratio in fe_src2dst_min_over_mean_ps might imply the use of evasion tactics like rate limiting to avoid triggering threshold alarms. The large standard deviation in dst2src_stddev_piat_ms indicates inconsistent packet transmission times, which could be a sign of spoofed packets or time-stamp manipulation commonly used by attackers for obfuscation purposes.
4. Confidence Analysis: With a confidence score of 41.1%, the model is reasonably confident in its classification as anomalous traffic indicative of Class 4 activities, but there remains some uncertainty that could be due to noise or atypical benign network behavior mimicking malicious patterns; hence continuous monitoring and retraining with updated data are recommended for maintaining accuracy.
