1. Prediction Assessment:
   The prediction is correct, as the predicted class "pfcp_session_deletion" matches the true class.

2. Key Contributing Factors:
   - fe_src2dst_min_over_mean_ps (importance 0.999733): This feature indicates a high consistency in packet sizes from controller to UPF.
   - dst2src_stddev_ps (importance 0.999730): There is low variability in the PFCP response sizes, which suggests stable behavior typical of session deletion processes.
   - src2dst_duration_ms (importance 0.999544): The duration over which packets are sent from controller to UPF is a significant factor, indicating that the process spans a specific timeframe consistent with session deletions.

3. Technical Interpretation:
   Since the prediction is correct and PFCP-related, we can interpret these features in the context of PFCP behavior for session deletion. The high consistency in packet sizes (fe_src2dst_min_over_mean_ps) and low variability in response sizes (dst2src_stddev_ps) suggest that the communication between the controller and UPF is stable and predictable, which is characteristic of a well-defined process like session deletion. Additionally, the duration over which these packets are sent (src2dst_duration_ms) aligns with the expected timeframe for completing such operations.

4. Confidence Analysis:
   The 100.0% confidence score indicates that the model has very high certainty in its prediction. This level of confidence is appropriate given the strong contributing factors and their alignment with the characteristics of PFCP session deletion processes, as evidenced by the SHAP feature attributions.
