1. Overall Assessment:
   The traffic pattern aligns with the predicted class due to significant deviations in PFCP signaling characteristics, particularly in packet size consistency and response variability.

2. Key Contributing Factors:
   - fe_src2dst_min_over_mean_ps: Indicates highly inconsistent packet sizes from controller to UPF.
   - dst2src_stddev_ps: Shows high variability in the sizes of responses from UPF to controller.
   - fe_dst2src_fin_rate: Reflects a high rate of signaling termination requests initiated by the UPF.

3. Technical Interpretation:
   These features suggest an abnormal PFCP control-plane behavior, such as inconsistent session modification requests and responses, which could indicate issues with state updates or signaling imbalance between the controller and UPFs.

4. Confidence Analysis:
   The 100.0% confidence score indicates a strong alignment of the observed traffic pattern with class 5 characteristics based on the model's training data, though it does not guarantee the prediction is correct in all contexts.
