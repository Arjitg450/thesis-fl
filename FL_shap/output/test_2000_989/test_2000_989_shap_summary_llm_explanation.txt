1. Overall Assessment: The traffic is classified as anomalous due to its high deviation from the mean packet interarrival times and standard deviations, which are significantly different in both directions of communication between source and destination IPs. This irregularity suggests potential malicious activity or network issues that warrant further investigation.
2. Key Contributing Factors: The top three features driving this decision include fe_src2dst_min_over_mean_ps, dst2src_stddev_ps, and bidirectional_piat_burstiness which have the highest SHAP values indicating their strong influence on classifying traffic as Class 3.
3. Technical Interpretation: The high fe_src2dst_min_over_mean_ps value suggests that there is a significant minimum packet interarrival time over mean, implying potential delays or congestion in the network flow from source to destination IPs. Similarly, dst2src_stddev_ps and bidirectional_piat_burstiness values indicate high variability in both directions of communication with bursty patterns that deviate significantly from normal traffic behavior.
4. Confidence Analysis: The model's 99.7% confidence score indicates a very strong belief in the classification as anomalous, suggesting minimal likelihood for misclassification based on these features alone. This high level of certainty reinforces the need to investigate further into potential security threats or network issues causing this abnormal traffic behavior.
